Implement a global search bar on the dashboard.
Allow search by lead name, number, or source for quick access.

Filter Options (Similar to Sales Dashboard)
Add filters for:
DNP (Do Not Pick)
CTC (Could Not Connect)
Last 10 Days Leads (recent activity view)

Added a "Reset" button next to the "Needed Leads" count for each caller.
Clicking "Reset" sets the needed leads count to 50 for that caller (demo logic).
The UI updates immediately.

Use a local leads state instead of sampleLeads for all lead operations.
On file upload, if a duplicate (by phone/email) is found, assign it to the same caller and mark as "new".
All lead table/filter logic now uses the updated leads state.
You must implement actual file parsing to fill uploadedLeads for real uploads.

The "Source" column is now "Source / Upload Date".
The upload date (lead.createdAt) is shown next to the source for each lead, formatted as a local date.
No other logic is changed.


**Sales Dashboard**
The comment input in the table view is now a multi-line <textarea>, resizable, with a minimum height for better usability.

Leads are now always displayed in chronological order (oldest at top, newest at bottom) in both cards and table view.

Total Leads Assigned (Daily Card)
Add a card-style display showing:
Total leads assigned today (Reset Each Day).

Remove Edit Button
Remove or disable the Edit button to prevent post-entry manipulation by sellers.


Red Color for Fake Leads
If a lead is marked as fake by the Accounts Team, color the lead row Red.
Allow seller to re-upload proofs for re-verification if needed.

When a lead is marked as "converted" (Close Success), set a new property opsVerified: false on the lead.
Do not send it to Accounts until the Ops team verifies it.
Show a visual indicator in the Sales dashboard that the lead is "Pending Ops Verification" after conversion.


Show only leads with status === 'converted' and opsVerified === false for verification.
After verification, set opsVerified: true (and only then should the lead be considered for Accounts).


Discount Proof Submission
If a discount is given to a student, seller must upload discount proof:
Add a new section for this OR
Allow as additional proof, like the "Old Student Proof" section.

Flexible Proof Format (PDF/Image)
Seller should be able to upload proof in:
Image format (JPEG, PNG)
OR a PDF file (for multiple payment screenshots compiled together)


Show the date each lead is received from the seller.
Display the seller’s name with each lead for easy identification.
Add a real-time notification system:
Notify OPS when a lead arrives.
Notify A/C team for verification.
Mark such leads as “Priority” for quick action.


Show the date each lead/account was received.
Display all uploaded proofs (payment, discount, books, form) as responsive images or PDF links.
Add a "Mark as Fake" button for each account.
On marking as fake, notify Seller & OPS (simulate with a notification banner).
Allow re-upload of proofs for re-verification, with date tracking.
Ensure images/PDFs are responsive for all screen sizes.
Accounts and OPS can work in parallel on the same lead.
